# housing_price_predict

For us, deploying the model will mean several things:

Storing the whole Scikit-Learn modelling pipeline as an object (independent from our notebook).
Creating a small web-app that acts as an interface for inputting data about a house to the model and can display the model prediction.
Publishing this web-app (together with the modelling pipeline) online for everyone to use.
